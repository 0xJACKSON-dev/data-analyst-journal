Data is a collection of facts. Data is a clay to make a brick. You can use data to look into the past, present, and future. [Real example of data analytics.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-analytics-examples)

> **Remember to understand the problem before jumping right into analysis. So that we can solve the right problem with the right answer and right data.**

## Process of Data Analysis

> The biggest mistake analysts make when using this framework is looking for quick and easy answers. This framework is not linear. We can go back and forth to make sure that all steps are correct and practical. And review your work in each phase to improve.

- **Ask:** business challenge, objective, or question

- **Prepare:** data generation, collection, storage, and data management

- **Process:** data cleaning and data integrity
